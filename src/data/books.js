      author: "Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Robson",
      publisher: "O'Reilly",
      year: 2014,
      pages: 704,
      description: "This brain-friendly guide teaches you everything from JavaScript language fundamentals to advanced topics, including objects, functions, and the browser’s document object model. You won’t just be reading—you’ll be playing games, solving puzzles, pondering mysteries, and interacting with JavaScript in ways you never imagined. And you’ll write real code, lots of it, so you can start building your own web applications. We think your time is too valuable to waste struggling with new concepts. Using the latest research in cognitive science and learning theory to craft a multi-sensory learning experience, Head First JavaScript Programming uses a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works, not a text-heavy approach that puts you to sleep. This book replaces Head First JavaScript, which is now out of print.",

      description: "This is an exciting time to learn JavaScript. Now that the latest JavaScript specification—ECMAScript 6.0 (ES6)—has been finalized, learning how to develop high-quality applications with this language is easier and more satisfying than ever. This practical book takes programmers (amateurs and pros alike) on a no-nonsense tour of ES6, along with some related tools and techniques. Author Ethan Brown (Web Development with Node and Express) not only guides you through simple and straightforward topics (variables, control flow, arrays), but also covers complex concepts such as functional and asynchronous programming. You’ll learn how to create powerful and responsive web applications on the client, or with Node.js on the server.",

      description: "Angular 2 is a JavaScript-based development platform for building dynamic, interactive web applications, SPAs, and mobile apps. Angular applications can be built with JavaScript or TypeScript. TypeScript offers great IDE support and the TypeScript compiler helps coders quickly find and fix errors. TypeScript feels familiar, much like using ES6 with the same standard and third-party libraries, idioms, and tools. TypeScript supports classes, modules, annotations, and lazy loading and minimizes the amount of code for supporting the framework's life cycle, letting developers focus on writing the application code.",

Managing data gets messy, handling browser incompatibilities takes time, juggling competing user interactions and integrating the work of multiple developers gets tricky. The Angular 2 framework handles these common problems, making it ideal for writing large-scale web applications that can be maintained, extended, and tested. Because it's popular, it offers a well-supported code base, vibrant community, and rich ecosystem. Best of all, Angular 2 emphasizes performance and focuses on mobile apps by being compact and memory efficient.",
